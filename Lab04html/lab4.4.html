<h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design,dense plantings,and a mixture of <br>ornamental and edible plants. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history can be traced back for centuries,although they were re- <br>invented in 1870's England,when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously
        <br>maintained <u>English estate gardens</u>.</p>
    <br>
<p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants,with an emphasis on vegetables and
    <br>herbs,along with some fruit trees.</p>
